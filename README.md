  - Summing values across multiple worksheets where the structure is the same
- Linking Workbooks:
  - Arrange all windows so you can see them simultaneously
  - Linking multiple workbooks
  - The link consists of :
    - Workbook name + Sheet name + absolute reference of cell required to link
- Consolidation Values by position and by reference:
  - Not updated dynamically of data
  - You can run it multiple times to update data.
  - Consolidation by References (Categories) from different worksheets that may not be typically identical

3rd Week:

- Named Ranges:
  - Name Box (Don&#39;t Use Hyphen or a space)
  - Any three letters followed by a number gives us a cell reference
  - Named Range gives us automatically the absolute cell reference
  - Name Box is not used to change the named range
- Create and Manage Ranges:
  - CMD + SHIFT + Down Arrow to select data in column till you hit a blank cell
  - Three ways to create name ranges:
    - Name Box
    - Define Names from Formula Tab
    - Create from Selection from Formula Tab
  - Managing Named Ranges:
    - Name Manager in Formulas Tab (Not for Mac Users) but Mac users can get simpler version through Define names in formula tab
- Apply Ranges to Formulas:
  - To get all named ranges, press F3
- Apply Names:
  - CMD + SHIFT + F3 -\&gt; Create Named Ranges from Selection
  - Apply Names is sublabeled in Define Name button in Formulas tab
  - As our workbooks gets complex it becomes more necessary to past all named ranges list by clicking F3 -\&gt; Paste List
  - Implicit Difference &amp; At Symbol @

4th Week:

- COUNT and COUNTIFS:
  - To extract some meaning from the data, we need to create these summary reports
  - COUNTIFS count the number of times &quot;certain criterias&quot; is met
  - SUMIFS sums a range based on &quot;certain criterias&quot;
  - In absolute cell references, we lock the column and we lock the row
  - Mixed cell references, we may lock the column but not the row or we can lock the row, but not the column
  - COUNT function counts all cells that contain a numeric value all empty cells are ignored
  - COUNTA Function counts all cells that contain both numerical and alphanumerical data all empty cells are ignored
  - COUNTBLANK function counts all empty cells
  - COUNTIFS needs two arguments (at least):
    - Criteria\_Range
    - Criteria1
    - For COUNTIFS, text and expressions must be within quotation marks
- SUMIFS(More than one criteria ranges, criteria):
  - SUM\_RANGE
  - CRITERIA\_RANGE 1
  - CRITERIA1
- Sparklines:
  - Sparklines are min-charts that fit in a Single Cell
  - Insert Tab then Sparklines
  - Sparklines are grouped together
- Advanced Charting:
  - Switching Row / Column
  - Select Data
  - Change Chart Type
  - Secondary Axis
  - Combo Chart (supported with line one overlay first axis)
- Trendlines:
  - Adjusting Vertical Scale through Formatting Axis
  - Add Trendline for Exponential, Linear, Logarithmic, Power Functions
  - R^2 closer to one the more it&#39;s linear
