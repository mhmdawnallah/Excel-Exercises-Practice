## _Excel Skills for Business_: Intermediate I:

## 1st Week:

- Multiple Worksheets:
  - Group Sheets
  - Sheets, tabs manipulations (Deleting - Inserting - Copying - moving -renaming - hiding - unhiding)
- 3D Formulas:
  - 3D Formulas vs 2D Formulas
  - Summing values across multiple worksheets where the structure is the same
- Linking Workbooks:
  - Arrange all windows so you can see them simultaneously
  - Linking multiple workbooks
  - The link consists of :
    - Workbook name + Sheet name + absolute reference of cell required to link
- Consolidation Values by position and by reference:
  - Not updated dynamically of data
  - You can run it multiple times to update data.
  - Consolidation by References (Categories) from different worksheets that may not be typically identical

## 2nd Week:

- Combining Text:
  - Concat Function
  - Ampersand symbol
- Text Case:
  - LOWER Function
  - UPPER Function
  - PROPER Function
- Extracting Text:
  - LEFT Function

  - **CTRL + :** to insert current time in a cell

## 3rd Week:

- Named Ranges:
  - Name Box (Don&#39;t Use Hyphen or a space)
  - Any three letters followed by a number gives us a cell reference
  - Named Range gives us automatically the absolute cell reference
  - Name Box is not used to change the named range
- Create and Manage Ranges:
  - CMD + SHIFT + Down Arrow to select data in column till you hit a blank cell
  - Three ways to create name ranges:
    - Name Box
    - Define Names from Formula Tab
    - Create from Selection from Formula Tab
  - Managing Named Ranges:
    - Name Manager in Formulas Tab (Not for Mac Users) but Mac users can get simpler version through Define names in formula tab
- Apply Ranges to Formulas:
  - To get all named ranges, press F3
- Apply Names:
  - CMD + SHIFT + F3 -\&gt; Create Named Ranges from Selection
  - Apply Names is sublabeled in Define Name button in Formulas tab
  - As our workbooks gets complex it becomes more necessary to past all named ranges list by clicking F3 -\&gt; Paste List
  - Implicit Difference &amp; At Symbol @

## 4th Week:

- COUNT and COUNTIFS:
  - To extract some meaning from the data, we need to create these summary reports
  - COUNTIFS count the number of times &quot;certain criterias&quot; is met
  - SUMIFS sums a range based on &quot;certain criterias&quot;
  - In absolute cell references, we lock the column and we lock the row
  - Mixed cell references, we may lock the column but not the row or we can lock the row, but not the column
  - COUNT function counts all cells that contain a numeric value all empty cells are ignored
  - COUNTA Function counts all cells that contain both numerical and alphanumerical data all empty cells are ignored
  - COUNTBLANK function counts all empty cells
  - COUNTIFS needs two arguments (at least):
    - Criteria\_Range
    - Criteria1
    - For COUNTIFS, text and expressions must be within quotation marks
- SUMIFS(More than one criteria ranges, criteria):
  - SUM\_RANGE
  - CRITERIA\_RANGE 1
  - CRITERIA1
- Sparklines:
  - Sparklines are min-charts that fit in a Single Cell
  - Insert Tab then Sparklines
  - Sparklines are grouped together
- Advanced Charting:
  - Switching Row / Column
  - Select Data
  - Change Chart Type
  - Secondary Axis
  - Combo Chart (supported with line one overlay first axis)
- Trendlines:
  - Adjusting Vertical Scale through Formatting Axis
  - Add Trendline for Exponential, Linear, Logarithmic, Power Functions
  - R^2 closer to one the more it&#39;s linear

## 5th Week:

- Create and Format Tables:
  - Table:
    - Hold database-style data
    - Column represents a field that contains a particular type of information
    - Record represents entire information about customer, or one transaction
    - Table Tab:
      - Contextual Ribbon Tab
      - Table Name
      - Banded Rows
      - â€¦etc features
    - Tables vs Ranges:
      - Tables:
        - Selection of Data is easier a lot than in Ranges
        - No need to worry about Freezing Panes when working with Tables
        - We&#39;re really looking to use them whenever we&#39;re working with raw data entries
        - It comes to trouble, when you&#39;re looking to create summaries of sections inside your table
      - Ranges:
        - Selection of Data is harder than in Tables
        - You need to worry about Freezing panes
        - Subtotal tool is available here
- Sort and Filter in Tables:
  - Removing Duplicates:
    - Table =\&gt; Remove Duplicates
  - Accessing Sort Function:
    - Sorting:
      - Table =\&gt; Filter Button
      - Data Tab
      - Home Tab
      - Right Click =\&gt; Sort
      - Header Row
  - Total Row
  - It is good practice to always clear filters,especially when you work in a shared Environment
- Automation:
  - Named Ranges are Automated with Table
  - CTRL SHIFT + Shortcut for adding new Row
  - Named Ranges Extend Automatically in Tables Not in Ranges
  - Charts Update automatically when they are attached to tables Unlike Ranges
- Subtotalling:
  - Feature in Excel that summarizes subsections of your data
  - We need to convert our table back to range
  - Subtotal creates outline on the left

## 6th Week:

- Pivot Tables:
  - Another way of summarizing and filtering large amounts of information to produce useful reports
  - It is Nicky Reccomendation to put data first in table before making Pivot tables as it makes Pivot Table much more responsive to changes
  - When you create pivot tables and click on it there are two ribbon tabs added:
    - PivotTable Analyze
    - Design
  - Pivot Tables are easily be pivoted or changed to get different views on the data
- Create and modify a pivot:
  - Insert then Create Pivot Tables
  - You can use Refresh Button in PivotTable Analyze Ribbon Tab
  - Show Values as (Percentage,...etc)
  - Summarize Values by(COUNT,SUM,...etc)
  - When you add two or more values to Rows, Columns you get subtotals
  - Report Layout:
    - Compact Form (By Default)
    - Outline Form
    - Tabular Form
- Group and Filter Data:
  - Group:
    - PivotTable Analyze then Group Selection
    - You can Ungroup by going to PivotTable Analyze Ribbon Tab then Ungroup
  - Sorting:
    - You can sort Data: click anywhere in pivot Table Area then Data Ribbon Tab then Sort
  - Filtering:
    - By Row
    - By Columns
    - Filters Panel
    - Show Report Filter Pages
    - Field List Button in Pivot table Analyze Ribbon Tab
    -
- Charts and Slicers:
  - Charts:
    - Pivot Table Analyze then Select Pivot Chart
    - The Pivot Charts always represent the Pivot Table
  - Slicers:
    - Another way of Filtering Data but they are incredibly easy to use
    - Analyze then Insert Slicer
    - You can connect slicers to multiple pivots
  - Pivot Tables + Pivot Charts + Pivot Slicers:
    - Interactive Visual Reports
    - Powerful Dashboards

## _Excel Skills for Business_: Intermediate II:

## 1st Week:

- Data Validation:
  - **Garbage In, Garbage Out:** The Quality of Information coming out cannot be better than the quality of information that went in
  - **Data Entry Validation**
  - Once **error**** gets **into our data, It can prove** problematic **to get** reliable ****information** from that data
  - Data then Data Validation Tool then choose validation criteria, Excel will only permit according to validation criteria
  - If the data is copy-pasted, or imported, it actually doesn&#39;t enforce data validation rules
- Drop-Down Lists:
  - Data then Data Validations then &quot;List&quot; Validation Criteria
  - Drop-Down List will be populated in the order you type it in
  - Make sure you separate your values with a comma
  - Look Up Down List
  - Advantage of converting your lookup list into a named range and table
  -
- Formulas in Data Validation:
- Working with Data Validations:
  - To Clear Validations, Select Column you wanna remove validations from, Data, Data Validations Button, finally Select Clear All
  - To Circle Invalid Data, Select Data Ribbon Tab, Data Validations arrow, Circle Invalid Data
  - If you&#39;re not familiar with the Excel file, you don&#39;t know where are Data Validations found, Formulas Assigned so it is easy to find by going to Home Ribbon Tab, Find &amp; Select Arrow, Go To Special, Check Data Validation
  - **Paste Special**
  - As you are working with Table, Data Validations Expands with you as you added new rows
  - **Formulas + Data Validations**
  - **Conditional Formatting + Data Validations**
  - Whole numbers don&#39;t include negative numbers, fractions, or decimals.
